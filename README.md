# Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that uses a TMDB dataset for preprocessing, vectorization, and predicting movies using cosine similarity. The system also integrates the TMDB API to filter recommended results along with pictures.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Using Jupyter Notebook to clean and prepare the TMDB dataset.
- **Vectorization:** Implementing vectorization techniques to convert movie data into vectors.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Calculating similarity between movies to provide recommendations.
- **TMDB API Integration:** Fetching additional movie details and pictures using the TMDB API.
- **Streamlit Application:** A web-based user interface to interact with the recommender system.

## Requirements

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- TMDB dataset
- TMDB API key
